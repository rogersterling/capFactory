    "problem_statement": "Despite significant advancements in technology and increasing consumer interest in sustainable transportation solutions in the autonomous electric vehicle (AEV) market, several key issues persist presenting barriers to market penetration and profitability for companies operating in this sector:Application: Most existing AEV companies are focusing on the consumer market by retrofitting sensors onto existing consumer vehicles and enhancing ADAS capabilities. However, these vehicles are not purpose-built for autonomous operation, thus falling short of true self-driving capabilities. Although some companies have plans for purpose-built vehicles in the future, they would have to redo all the real-world testing as consumer vehicles have vastly different driving patterns, vehicle dynamics, passenger and safety requirements, and sensor/tech specifications, compared to purpose-built shuttles. Moreover, the presence of non-autonomous vehicles on the roads adds complexity and variables that the current state of autonomous software cannot safely handle, unless there are dedicated routes supported by local authorities.Changing Trends: Unforeseen disruptions such as the Covid-19 pandemic, remote work trends, and economic shifts, have significantly altered the transportation landscape in the past five years. As fewer people own personal vehicles, particularly in urban areas, public transit systems are struggling to adapt and provide accessible and reliable solutions. Additionally, public transit has developed a negative perception among the growing middle-class consumer as an unsafe and unreliable option. This has led to an average of 5 occupants per standard city bus in sprawling cities like DFW.Cost and Affordability: The high initial cost of electric and autonomous vehicles remains a significant barrier for many consumers. While the total cost of ownership over the vehicle's lifespan may be lower than traditional internal combustion engine vehicles, the upfront cost often presents a deterrent, particularly in price-sensitive market segments. Addressing cost barriers and enhancing affordability is essential for expanding the customer base and achieving economies of scale in production.Technological Reliability and Safety: While advancements in autonomous driving technology have been substantial, concerns regarding the reliability and safety of these systems persist. Incidents involving autonomous vehicles, such as accidents or system malfunctions, undermine public trust and confidence in the technology. Ensuring the robustness and safety of autonomous systems is crucial for widespread adoption and market acceptance.Addressing these challenges requires a multifaceted approach involving collaboration among industry stakeholders, policymakers, and technology innovators. By overcoming these obstacles, the autonomous electric vehicle industry can realize its potential to revolutionize transportation, reduce emissions, and create a more sustainable future.",

In industries like aerial land surveying, urban planning, environmental monitoring, and defense, the ability to process, analyze, and visualize large volumes of geospatial data is critical. However, traditional methods are resource-intensive, require specialized expertise, and are often cost-prohibitive for many organizations.Key problems we solve include:High Complexity and Technical Barriers: Many organizations struggle to leverage advanced geospatial technologies, such as AI/ML-based feature extraction and real-time data processing, due to the expertise required.Scalability and Cost: Handling large geospatial datasets requires significant hardware investments and infrastructure, making it difficult for businesses to scale operations efficiently.Slow Data Processing and Analysis: Industries like aerial land surveying and defense need real-time insights from geospatial data. Traditional solutions often result in delays, reducing the effectiveness of decision-making.Integration and Usability: Many existing geospatial tools are difficult to integrate with enterprise systems, and their complex interfaces can deter non-technical users.SpatialScale's cloud-based platform solves these challenges by providing an easy-to-use, scalable, and affordable geospatial cloud computing solution that automates and optimizes geospatial workflows, making advanced analytics accessible to a broader range of industries.",

When fridges are stocked to the brim with all sorts of ingredients, be it your own or roommates, it’s hard to keep track of what’s going bad. In fact, the average household wastes 31.9% of the food it acquires. This is about $1,866 worth of food each year for a household, amounting to over $240 billion annually in America alone.Moreover, when an expiry date is up, that doesn't necessarily mean something has gone bad. Yet, it's estimated that 91% of consumers discard food based on the \"sell by\" date, mistaking it for a safety indicator. Figuring out if food is safe to eat or how to even store it correctly can be a time-consuming series of google searches nobody wants to bother with. And it's important to mention there are 10 different sources who all say different things. That's just too much work.Unused and expired groceries are one of the largest contributors to food waste today. In a day and age where inflation is rampant and groceries are expensive as ever, it's crucial that people use the groceries they buy to their full potential, wasting less and saving more.",

Except unlike a multitool that can typically perform many functions but none better than a dedicated tool, Creative 3D's printers outperform the competition with each of the individual functions the company combines. Not only does Creative 3D's printers encompass these separated printing functions, but also enables the combination of them. Users can merge the separated functions of printers to create previously impossible to produce parts, or bolster single 3D printing functions. Paired with the fact that Creative 3D's first product is more than 80% less expensive than the closest competitor, the company's products are an ideal solution for any customer, even if they don't have a need for multiple functionalities.3D printers are tools that are made to overcome current design constraints, so why should they obey the same constraints when being designed or produced? Creative 3D wasn't satisfied with the answer of \"Because everyone else is,\" and set forth to design a 3D printer from the ground up ignoring industry standards, design constraints, and production constraints. As a result, Creative 3D created a modular platform that can be relevant for years to come, and is adaptable to change and improve as 3D printing does. This set the basis of how Creative 3D will break the mold in the design and production of products, doing everything in-house with custom production and testing tools. The market loves the product and is salivating awaiting the company's move to production. With the immense growth of the marketplace and buying cycle of original adopters of 3D printing requiring new more capable printers, it's an ideal time for Creative 3D to be launching!",

The problem it aims to solve can be summarized as follows:Problem: High and chronic Cost Overruns, Schedule Delays, and Inefficiencies in the multi-trillion USD Capital Projects sector.Cost Overruns: Capital projects, such as construction, infrastructure development, and engineering endeavors, frequently experience cost overruns. These overruns can be substantial, leading to financial strain and sometimes project abandonment.Schedule Delays: Projects often fail to meet their deadlines due to mismanagement, unforeseen obstacles, and stakeholder coordination issues. These delays can escalate costs and hinder project success.Lack of Accountability: Traditional project management approaches need more transparency, making holding stakeholders accountable for their roles and responsibilities challenging. This lack of accountability can result in disputes and project setbacks.Inefficient Data Management: Many projects involve multiple participants from various organizations, making it difficult to synchronize data, schedules, and contractual obligations. This inefficiency can lead to miscommunication and costly errors.Limited Collaboration: Siloed project management practices hinder collaboration between different parties involved in a project, including contractors, suppliers, and project owners.Inadequate Forecasting: Traditional project management lacks sophisticated tools for accurate forecasting. Project planners struggle to anticipate potential challenges, allocate resources efficiently, and make informed decisions without precise forecasting, contributing to cost overruns and schedule delays.Market Opportunity:Construction projects account for more than 10 Trillion in annual spending and lose more than 1 Trillion due to inadequate digitization. Megaprojects account for 5-8% of Global GDP and the average capital project loses 1.2 billion. There is a vast market opportunity to address these problems. It focuses on providing innovative solutions to streamline project management, enhance transparency, and enable collaboration across organizational boundaries. The market opportunity includes industries that heavily rely on capital projects, such as construction, engineering, infrastructure development, and more. The potential impact is not only financial but also extends to improved project delivery, resource allocation, and overall industry efficiency.Cybereum's goal is to empower organizations to complete projects on time, within budget, and with greater accountability, ultimately transforming how complex projects are planned, executed, and delivered.",

Many to almost non of those clinics offer x-ray due to costly acquisition and operation. Rural clinics operated by Indian Health Service also hardly offer x-ray due to the cost and difficulty of operations and maintenance.Applications in ambulatory operations: Ambulances  hardly have an x-ray unit in them due to cost, bulkiness and difficulty of operations, although a few x-ray taken on the trauma scene and sent to the hospital before the patient arrives can speed up the decision making process and expedite the early response treatment which is crucial to the patient survival and recovery. A knoevelCam system which packs in a carry-on size impact suitcase can be put in every ambulances, a medic can set up the unit in a few minutes and take several x-rays in a couple of minutes and send the images to the hospital before the patient gets to the hospital.Population of the earth has doubled since a 100 years ago and we mostly live in highly populated and dense areas. Major threat to our health has been raspatory illnesses which we have seen a trend of every 10 years, SARS in 2002 China, MERS 2012 Saudi Arabia, Covid 19 in 2020 to 2022 globally. Covid 19 showed how lack of ability to take chest x-ray put a constraint on accurate diagnostic of Covid 19 and hence elevated risk and cost and in many cases death due to poor diagnostic. On the next pandemic, every urgent clinic can afford to own a KnovelCam x-ray camera system and set it up anywhere, like in a tent in a parking lot and take chest x-rays. All components of the system run on batteries and all are wirelessly connected through a local wi-fi set by the work station not a building or mobile carrier. An image is available to view by the medics on site  with in seconds of taking an x-ray or can be uploaded and submitted to KnovelPACS.ai for radiologists or AI read.In Military, there are combat support hospitals and Mobile Army Surgical Hospitals in many of which x-ray is under-provided or not provided due to bulkiness and difficulty of operations. KnovelCam x-ray camera system can be packed in a tactical backpack, get set up in under 3 minutes, shoot and compile an x-ray image in a few seconds for the medics on site. With a Starlink internet connection, image is then gets automatically uploaded on KnovelPACS.ai for radiology or AI read.In veterinary space: In the field and in an out-patient scenario, instead of taking an equine to a hospital, a vet can show up with all gears including x-ray to take images, diagnose and treat. In the clinic, in orthopedic surgery, x-ray can be brought in the surgery unit and operate there instead of having to move the animal patient with all life supply gears to the imaging room. Less risk and faster treatment.In Podiatry space: Instead of moving patients, imagine an old woman or man who happen to be over 300 lbs having to get off a wheelchair and climb up an x-ray station to get an x-ray of the very foot who they have a hard time getting on. With KnovelCam x-ray system, x-ray can be taken to the patient instead of vice-versa. X-ray components can be placed around the patients foot to get an image.KnovelCam conducted a study in a podiatry clinic with 5 exam rooms and found that they save almost 90 minutes on a busy day by not having to move the patients from exam rooms to the x-ray room. Instead they took the x-ray unit from one exam room to another to take x-rays.",

Traditionally, airports, law enforcement, and border patrol have relied on sniffer dogs—an expensive and logistically complex method. Our technology offers a faster, more economical solution, eliminating the need for trained animals. Our compact device functions as a handheld unit or an integrated component in systems like X-ray scanners. It rapidly identifies various substances, including new drug variations, providing a non-invasive detection method that protects law enforcement personnel and K9 units from hazardous exposure.Our objective is to develop a versatile, general-purpose smell sensor adaptable to various industries, including healthcare, manufacturing, retail, automotive, agriculture, and hospitality. Ultimately, we aim to miniaturize this technology for integration into smartphones, voice assistants, and other smart devices, unlocking vast new possibilities.",

Detection methods are varied but often insufficient. For example, sniffer dogs, while effective, are cost-prohibitive—each costing around $65,000. This limits the number of dogs available to law enforcement, and any contact with these substances can be fatal to the dogs. Manual inspections pose similar risks. Fentanyl test strips, another common method, are prone to human error, require direct contact with the substance, and struggle to keep up with the evolving variants of fentanyl. This crisis demands innovative solutions that can keep pace with the rapidly changing landscape of drug variants and offer safer, more efficient detection methods.",

As 5G connectivity to the cloud grows, there is still a gap in accessing data sources that are typically deployed where power and internet are not available. Existing wireless are not reliable causing unpredictable ROI for the wireless operator especially in high density deployments. We offer the first environmentally aware wireless system for reliable communication in unlicensed (free) spectrum with extended battery life. Our patented Multi-core Radio Processor technology can detect and attenuate environmental impairments (aggressors) to maximize capacity of the wireless network in any deployment scenario. Technology is backwards compatible to existing standards and agnostic to protocol. We believe our fundamental new class of wireless technology will become a necessity for all wireless in the future.",

This trend is similar to the growth of WiFi routers in homes couple of decades ago. There is a data bottleneck between these 5G routers and the operational field (warehouses, factory floors, construction sites, etc). Existing 5G routers can connect to only a handful of assets over wires. In order to extend 5G routers to access 100s and 1000s of data assets, a reliable wireless solution is needed that can meet 5-10 yrs of battery life. Commercial wireless like 5G, WiFi, Bluetooth do not meet the reliability and battery life requirements. We are solving this problem with our multi-core wireless. Our solution can scale performance and tracks the environment simply by adding more cores independent of the preferred wireless protocol. Customers no longer need to wait for the next standard to come out.",

Post-acute care treatment and recovery is normally done in specialized rehab clinics, where 90% of patients are un-monitored. The normal monitoring is spot checks every 6-8 hours or by a camera a Virtual Patient Assistant. Abrupt fatality can occur within one hour since symptoms began or within 24 hours of being alive without symptoms, a leading cause of death is Sudden Cardiac Death. Nurses are constantly torn between monitoring and patient care; hence, continuous real-time monitoring is necessary to protect lives. With Cardi/o’s tailored alerts, nurses get early warnings for any episodic events, thus allowing them to confidently provide the best possible care for all their patients, before it is too late –improving patient outcomes and lowering risk for the organizationThe problem lies in the nature of heart issues: They are intermittent, making them incredibly difficult to capture. Every 34 seconds someone in the US is having a heart attack and 50% of deaths occur in individuals without a history of heart disease. When it comes to heart health, time is of the essence, requiring swift action. Continuous Heart Monitoring is simply the only solution for prevention world's foremost health concern - sudden episodic events.

The addressable market is $5.0+ billion with 1.6 million procedures performed annually.Founded by cardiologist Dr. Mehran Khorsandi and medical devices engineer Henry Bourang, ABS is positioned to solve one of the most technically challenging problems – the treatment of coronary bifurcation lesions - that has eluded the medical device world since the first human implant of a coronary stent in 1986.  Bifurcation lesions are prevalent in about 35% of Coronary Artery Bypass Grafting (“CABG”) procedures and about 20% of Percutaneous Coronary Intervention (“PCI”) procedures. Patients confronting coronary bifurcation lesions are currently left with only two options: (1) complex stenting procedures with suboptimal and unpredictable results; or (2) higher risk, and more expensive, open-heart CABG surgery.The ABS System is not a stent. It is a proprietary stent delivery system. From prototype to final product, the ABS System has been evaluated through bench testing, animal implants (at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center Los Angeles) and 10 human implants across 3 international medical centers – all with successful results. The ABS System is specifically designed to efficiently treat coronary bifurcation lesions with predictable results.The key attributes of ABS are:•\thighly simplified approach to bifurcation stenting (which is a growing clnical challenge: ~20% of coronary PCIs and ~35% of CABGs present with bifurcation lesions)•\tABS’s 6F bifurcation platform is designed for automatic orientation and alignment: ~10-15 minutes for procedure completion with full lesion coverage and side-branch access•\tUS$22 million invested to date, with US$10.4 million Series A Preferred financing (Nov 2020)•\t65 issued and 17 pending patents with freedom to operate opinion•\tfirst-in-human trials (10 patients) completed with 100% success (with 1 year follow-up) and excellent clinical results•\tfully developed product with regulatory pathway clearly defined•\tlarge, and growing, addressable market (US$5+ billion)•\tinstitutional investors and Board members•\tKOL support from leading cardiologists globally•\tmultiple exist pathways with timing alternatives.Video Links:\thttps://youtu.be/FpF7asGAdeY   https://youtu.be/dFwX_PR2SLk",

We are in this 'attention economy' and fans want more, they want it fast and they want it THIER way.Sports/entertainment properties are struggling to keep fans engaged especially beyond game day. 1) sports properties know very little about their fans and 2) they don't have that personal relationship with them because of lack of data on them. In this new era of sports distribution where we are seeing big tech, for the first time in history, get into the sports content game individual teams are going more Direct-to-Consumer and need to learn more about their global fan base and offer personalized experiences.In conclusion, today’s fans want to be active participants and not just the consumers of the content during live/on demand events. As fans we want to contribute our take on things, thoughts, pictures, videos and opinions just like we do on every other social media platform out there. Social media has trained us that our likes, comments, and content matter. And that's why big tech/social platforms make billions, and most sports properties don't. At Providential Media, we are building the solutions to change all of this.",

Paper & PDF credentials are easy to fake, hard to verify, and easily lost or destroyed.When PDF file first came out in 1993, it was the source of truth as not many people had the access or the knowledge to use photoshop. But today anyone can photoshop straight from their phone without special training.The issue of fake credentials not only undermines the credibility of the individuals who hold them, but also undermines the overall trust and value of education. This has significant economic and social consequences, as employers and society as a whole rely on credentials to determine the knowledge and skills of individuals. The current system of paper and PDF credentials is therefore no longer adequate and a more secure and trustworthy solution is needed.",

On a per restaurant level, that is around $70K/per restaurant in pure cost savings they’re foregoing. With experience in the food service industry amongst all 3-team members, in addition to the 35+ client interviews we’ve conducted, it became clear that this problem is fueled by restaurant owners making food sourcing decisions ‘by-ear’ and generally involves little data analysis.",

Our robotic automation systems can move materials, clean ramps off debris, inspect pavement, and patrol the perimeter continuously 24/7/365 and deliver better results along with data and imaging that can be used for performance measurement and process optimization.  We are experienced in both airport and air carrier operations and are trusted to deliver a solution that will meet your safety expectations and those of your regulators, FAA or otherwise.  In this post-pandemic environment where your operations are growing but your workforce isn't, maybe more human resources isn't the answer.

It protects data at the data byte level, wherever it is wherever it goes inside or outside of the organization, and restores both Data and The System that runs it in every organization, in real-time.  Without paying ransom.STASH mitigates attacks by thwarting the attempted damage and getting businesses up and running again in several hours instead of several weeks or months. Data and The System it runs on are completely restored. Business Downtime at $500-600,000 per hour eliminated. No ransomware payment to make.STASH was built with today's organizations in mind. Its modular format works with all legacy systems and tools as well as new ones; it will fill the defensive security gap, and if an organization chooses, replace lower value, lower performance tools.Run from an Admin Dashboard, there are no changes to workflows or user dependencies. There isn't another breakthrough out there that accomplishes all this, cost-effectively, simultaneously addressing the growing shortage of technology talent and winning at the ransomware chess game.You owe it to your company to take a look - this is the dawn of the least effort, most effective solution for data breach.Sound too good to be true? We hear that pretty often. Until we show that our steak actually matches the sizzle. You'll know without a doubt - and just like that, you'll breathe a sigh of relief.",

With 50 Billion connected endpoints in the world and growing, this simply isn't possible.

The first-of-its-kind, FDA Class II DeNovo Diagnostic test kit, with issued patents in the U.S., EU, Australia and Japan, provides primary care and ENT physicians with a simple and accurate point-of-care test for sinusitis that takes 20 minutes to achieve results and allows healthcare providers to determine the 10% of patients that have bacterial sinusitis and can benefit from antibiotics from the 90% that have viral sinusitis where antibiotics are ineffective. The Sinu-Test diagnostics test kit will help providers reduce the number of unnecessary antibiotic prescriptions, increase revenue to the clinic using established CPT reimbursement codes that pay $55 per test and reduce the overall treatment costs for these illnesses from $400 to $125 with the use of the Sinu-Test.

This means that you’re past the competitive selection process, but need to find a champion to fund the proposal yourself. It is notoriously difficult to get funding and most companies just resubmit the next solicitation period.\nHowever, In Orbit has found a champion within USSOCOM to pick up our proposal and fund it. For this work, we will develop a precision cargo delivery capability via weather balloon while progressing our space to Earth delivery capability through prototyping and testing. The weather balloon capability is a natural stepping stone and can also lead to an early revenue generator for In Orbit."

This is a module robotic system that sorts and exchanges materials between itself and other space assets, such as stations, manufacturing equipment, or another REX. We prototyped and built the first version that operates in an autonomous mode to transfer a resource between itself and another REX.

Both state and non-state actors are leveraging commercially available systems, capitalizing on the miniaturization and autonomy of these devices. In defense applications, expensive standalone fixed-wing systems can be complemented by modified quadrotor and fixed-wing UAS assembled from commercial components. This expands the use of drones to squad-level operations and special forces missions in artillery targeting, anti-armor, and anti-ship capacities. More sophisticated adversaries may employ swarms of diverse UAS types to conduct complex operations. Such swarms can overwhelm surface-to-air missile (SAM) defenses, exposing these systems to targeted follow-up attacks. Swarms also enable intra-drone communication, reducing the impact of jamming and allowing for multi-vehicle kill systems.The miniaturization and affordability of UAS components also empower bad actors in urban environments. UAS can be employed for espionage with a low risk of detection, drug trafficking across borders, or even hacking via drone-delivered equipment. Terrorist groups have also utilized retrofitted civilian drones. The use of commercial UAS allows malicious actors to disguise their intent, complicating counter-UAS (C-UAS) efforts. The inability to differentiate between threat and non-threat is exacerbated by the current high cost of interception.",

From mom & pop retailers to the Fortune 500, no one has figured out how to keep up.Traditional coding is too inefficient to meet the need, and \"no-code\" tools are too constraining to make a dent.Three big problems inherent to software development are the root of the issue:1. Becoming a proficient coder takes years, and the landscape shifts while you learn2. The people creating solutions are too far away from the problem, creating inefficiency3. Changes & experimentation while building are too costly and require inter-department participation (design, dev, etc.)",

Senseye's diagnostic platform (Senseye Dx) asks patients to look at the screen of their mobile phone and perform simple ocular tasks while Senseye measures their eyes' response to stimuli. Senseye then provides their clinician with a binary differential diagnosis for PTSD, MDD, and GAD as well as a severity score.Senseye leverages machine learning and computer vision technologies to operationalize science that has been well established for decades. For the first time, patients and clinicians have access to an accurate, objective measure of the patient's condition during treatment.",

There are also a large numbers of misdiagnosis or no diagnosis due to subjective self reporting. Misdiagnosis rates are 65.9% for major depressive disorder, 80.5% for PTSD and 71.0% for generalized anxiety disorder. For some conditions, such as PTSD, trauma disclosure is required to receive a diagnosis under DSM5 criteria - studies show that the average time from trauma to disclosure to a mental health professional is 7-10 years. During this period patients are often treated for symptoms of their PTSD rather than the underlying condition leading to worsening and sometimes devastating mental and physical health outcomes.Senseye's regulated diagnostic platform aims to replace the standard questionnaires for diagnosing PTSD, MDD, and GAD, and is the first regulated mental health diagnostic that the FDA is considering for approval. Senseye helps diagnose PTSD without requiring trauma disclosure, reducing the stigma associated with seeking mental health care. It provides signals that can be used to make clinical decisions, by quickly identifying patients facing mental health issues to intervene before suicidal thoughts occur, without requiring trauma disclosure, and assisting in determining treatment effectivity. Moving to measurement based care has the potential to decrease healthcare costs by 65% - 90% and help reduce the estimated $1trillion p.a. productivity losses to anxiety and depressive disorders.",

Frontier Resource Recovery attacks this problem by transforming detrimental agricultural waste into a dual-purpose solution: they turn waste into biochar through their innovative pyrolysis technology, which sequesters carbon and also facilitates soil restoration in depleted areas.This opportunity is particularly interesting due to the growing trend of global corporations pledging to attain 'Net Zero.' These companies are actively looking to buy Carbon Offset Retirement Credits from organizations like Frontier that are involved in extensive carbon sequestration. The current market supply of biochar-based carbon credits from existing companies falls significantly short of the high demand from corporations seeking to procure them, which puts Frontier's unique approach in a great position to answer their call.",

    "description": "Anact is a sustainable CPG brand that is solving our customers' problems of mildewy towels by providing a hemp towel that naturally resists the growth of bacteria to a $25B TAM. But that’s just the beginning. We’re building what we would like to describe if Patagonia and Tesla had a baby type of brand that is more than just CPG.Our vision is to  reintroduce hemp textile manufacturing back into the United States to create circular and closed looped vertical textile infrastructure to sell to a $1T market.  Picture being able to go to farms and see hemp that is being grown by farmers and then processed in a factory next to Tesla and distributed to local markets. That’s what we’re creating and what we were recently interviewed for in Texas Monthly. This is imperative that we build because China produces more than half of global textiles.Anact currently sells DTC and wholesale. We have sold $600K+ since the inception of the business in April 2020. We currently have enough inventory on hand to hit the $1M sales milestone. We are growing on our Shopify channel (we rank #1 on Google for hemp towels), Amazon (we’re Amazon’s Choice), and wholesale (boutique hotels, spas, gyms, yoga studios, and specialty retail). We are launching on Target.com and Wayfair this month. We are currently fundraising to secure capital to make several strategic key hires to the $1M sales milestone. The strategic hires that we want to make is a PR firm that represents TOMs shoes, Yeezy, Stance Socks, and Futurestitch, a company that recently launched a domestic manufacturing plant for textiles in Dallas, TX.In 2024-2025, we’d like to open a physical space that has a juice bar that we can work from and use as a storefront + event space + co-working space to better connect and share the pulse of the brand here in Austin, TX. Anact was founded in 2018 by Brianna Kilcullen, a veteran of the apparel industry who ran supply chain and  sustainability programs at Under Armour,  prAna, and Columbia Sportswear.Anact was successfully funded on Kickstarter in 2019 and launched online during the height of the pandemic in 2020 out of Jacksonville, Florida. Anact towels are currently sold throughout the United States and more than 10+ countries around the world.Anact’s values are based on the idea that simple acts make a positive impact on the world around you. Anact's acts are to disrupt the textile industry through education while also pushing to innovate and automate the hemp textile supply chain in the markets they serve.Anact believes in closing the loop of the supply chain by creating products that are made to last and can be repurposed once their original use is complete. Anact wants to disrupt the textile industry in every facet of what they do by not only creating a beautiful and useful product that gives back to the farmers, garment workers, and customers but is also sustainable without any sacrifice. Each product comes with an impact score that is provided by Greenstory.",

Our patented 3D printer design is making large size printing faster and more cost effective than ever before.  Industries are adopting 3D for both prototype work as well as production of final use parts at record rates.  New materials are making 3D printed parts stronger and more capable while key patents expiring just in the last year are opening up new machines design options which previously weren't available",

These lab diagnostics are also expensive and typically done in centralized labs, which requires time for transport and/or multi-day analysis as well complex sample preparation steps.

Today, I'm here to introduce you to AIs & Shine, a revolutionary AI-powered life management platform born from my own journey of self-discovery and optimization.Imagine having a personal AI assistant that truly understands you - your personality, your goals, your challenges, and your daily life. That's what AIs & Shine offers.We're living in an age where AI is becoming increasingly integrated into our lives, but most AI interactions are generic, failing to account for our individual complexities. AIs & Shine changes that.Our platform creates a comprehensive digital model of each user, synthesizing data from personality assessments, daily habits, personal goals, and even communication styles. This model then powers AI interactions across various life domains - from productivity and decision-making to personal growth and relationships.For example, AIs & Shine can provide personalized insights to improve your relationships based on your attachment style and communication preferences. It can help prioritize your tasks not just by deadline, but by aligning them with your core values and long-term goals. It can even offer customized interpretations of the content you consume, making learning more relevant and actionable for you.What sets AIs & Shine apart is its holistic approach. While other AI tools focus on narrow applications, we're creating a unified platform that enhances AI interactions across all areas of life. It's not just about productivity or personal growth - it's about creating a digital representation of you that can interface with current and future AI technologies in a way that's truly personalized.I've experienced firsthand the transformative power of this approach. Using an early version of AIs & Shine, I've gained profound insights into my own behavior patterns, improved communication in my relationships, and even uncovered new opportunities for personal growth and financial gain. It's helped me navigate major life transitions and rediscover my entrepreneurial spirit.We're currently developing our MVP, focusing on modules for self-understanding and relationships. We're seeking partners who share our vision of a future where AI truly understands and serves individual human needs.",

Current AI applications often operate in silos, addressing isolated aspects of a person's life without considering the holistic nature of human experience. This fragmented approach leads to suboptimal AI assistance, missed opportunities for personal growth, and a disconnect between AI's potential and its practical application in daily life. As AI becomes increasingly integrated into our world, there is a critical need for a unified, personalized AI system that can comprehensively understand each individual, adapt to their specific circumstances, and provide tailored insights and support across all areas of life. The absence of such a system leaves people struggling to fully leverage AI's capabilities for their personal and professional development, ultimately hindering their ability to navigate the complexities of modern life and achieve their full potential.",

This is completely disrupting a market sector that is projected to grow to $2.1T by 2032.Splashmetrics is the world’s first AI-driven SaaS solution solely focused on the rapidly accelerating shift toward self-serve B2B buying. For enterprise businesses, self-serve selling with Splashmetrics can result in a ~7X increase in marketing and sales ROI.Our revolutionary AI-driven platform helps automate the planning, execution, and measurement of smart-content-driven, hyper-personalized, self-serve sales journeys. For example, our Manage component collaboratively aligns all GTM stakeholders across the enterprise around a 5-touch content-driven sales cycle from initial engagement to closed deal. Then with 1-click from that collaborative strategic plan, our underlying SplashLogicAI automates much of the execution, integration, and measurement of this strategy-driven, hyper-personalized sales content via our SplashMaker+ smart content component. This includes full integration with leading platforms such as HubSpot, Marketo, SalesForce, etc. where the sale team receives a completely new class of real-time qualification data directly from these Buyers. And finally, our Analyze component leverages this end-to-end RevOps intelligence to provide 360°, CRO-level analytics specifically focused on the efficacy these strategic self-serve selling efforts. Finally, based on this measurement, our SplashLogicAI provides users best-practice feedback and recommendations for improving their self-serve selling efforts.Splashmetrics is led by Steve Brothers, whose experience consists of almost two decades in enterprise B2B Marketing Strategy and Creative work via his previous award-winning agency, Watershed 5. Splashmetrics is primarily bootstrapped to this point, has paying customers, and is an alum of both the Capital Factory and MassChallenge programs.",

This is the new “B2B sales conversation”. Delivering on this demand not only bridges the long-standing marketing and sales divide within a company, but vastly improves sales and ROI (up to 7X).

The story of the material and what it can do inspires us to create clothing as dynamic as the fabric.The name LIVSN comes from the Swedish word \"livsnjutare,\"​ which roughly translates to \"one who loves life deeply; an enjoyer of life.\"​ We know we won't regret more time outside - or with friends - or with family.Abraham Maslow's famous Hierarchy of Needs lists clothing among the physiological needs to meet before moving on towards the ultimate goal of self-actualization. If clothing is something that we must have, then we believe it should perform well, look good, be ethically made, environmentally friendly - and it should last.We design our clothing to be dynamic, made with naturally technical materials, and have a subdued style.We're not out to make the \"best\"​ shirt or the \"most advanced\"​ jacket in the world. We want to make good clothing, we want to make it with tried and true methods, and we want to make it with high quality materials and modern fits.We'll be officially launching in late 2018, but will have plenty to share before then.

Voltage Issue: RVs use 12v DC from batteries, unlike homes that use 24v AC from the grid.2. Wiring Complexity: Homes have standard HVAC wiring; RVs do not. In fact, RVs can have over 10 different wiring setups.3. Unstable Wi-Fi: About 70% of RVs don't have reliable Wi-Fi, a must-have for most smart devices.4. No Custom Fits: Most smart systems aren't designed for the RV lifestyle, offering little in terms of customization or integration.For RV Makers:1. Too Many Controls: Each appliance supplier has their own control unit, and does not talk to each other, so an RV could have separate controls for AC, heat, water heating, etc.2. Rigidity: The current control center in RVs is wired and rigid. Users can't easily add or remove features.3. Pet Monitoring: 60% of RV owners travel with their pets but none of the HVAC products offers room temp monitoring/alert features since they do not have smart thermostats.This combination of challenges creates a substantial gap in the market. WalTech's smart thermostats are engineered to overcome these obstacles, offering a tailored solution for the unique demands of RV living.TAM: $2.5 Billion (only travel trailers and fifth wheel that is 85% of the RV market)SAM: $2.15 Billion (85% of TAM that are compatible easily uses Dometic/Coleman/Furrion/GE thermostats)SOM: $647 Million (30% of SOM are frequent travelers who travel more than 55 days a year)",

At the end of 2022, we decided to move fully from the service sector to the product sector after our portfolio of work became increasingly centered around defense projects and we were being commissioned to develop more and more solutions that others could not.We are currently raising capital for the launch of our first product, Prometheus, an AI integrated IoT network security and surveillance system, which is intended to aid in the curbing of criminal activity along the Texas border and for military and defense purposes. In later phases of development, versions of Prometheus are also planned to be implemented in schools to prevent acts of violence and in commercial retail establishments for use in marketing and analytics data gathering.We are currently working on version 1 of Prometheus for border use and an MVP of Prometheus is available for demonstrations.A beta version of the software component can be ready in as little as two months of funding. Software can be implemented on any camera stream, is app based, and exists in both cloud and localized versions.We are currently in our Seed 1 round of raising capital and are looking to raise a total of $500k with only $200k being needed to get the beta version of our software component to market.This round of funding allows for 12 months of runway and is to be used to finish the development of the software component of our system to bring to market (2 months), establish contracts with police forces and border entities, move forward on establishing contracts with military entities, and begin to bring the hardware component into contracts.The next round of funding will focus on multiple versions of Prometheus and acquisition of federal border and further defense contracts for Prometheus. The next version will also include a server only version that replaces any surveillance server with Prometheus.-Our Team:Mike McDonald - CEOFormer President - Gnostic Systems, Former Director of Manufacturing Solutions Central Region - Northrop Grumman, Former Staff Engineer - IBM.

Customer orders will be placed via the brand site, and fulfilled directly. Patients/clients can then use Phantom Edge at home in-between visits/training sessions and chose share their performance data with their provider for better overall outcomes. \nSecond vertical - sports specific, e.g skiing (through our Advisor Ted Ligety), hockey, tennis, pickleball etc - utilizing the same model as in the initial vertical. \nThird Vertical - once we have traction through B2B verticals, we will enter a full DTC launch. Plan to enter a strategic partnership/merger with an established consumer wellness/fitness company for the DTC launch."

These standards exist to keep the occupants safe from airborne infections. Before the Covid-19 pandemic, hospitals used the \"ostrich\" defense. Hospitals only have to test the airflow only once a year, and they only test about 15% of the building. Even more astounding, the hospitals are subject to field audits from the accreditation services only every three years to maintain their licenses to operate.There is another big problem too. The hospitals and owners of other public buildings, like schools, offices, entertainment venues, etc., have spent billions of dollars to build and modernize their ventilation systems. They incorporated the Energy Efficiency recommendations, which are built to optimize the occupant’s comfort (i.e. temperature) vs. energy consumption”.  Energy Efficient systems have some features that are good, like advanced filtration and increased insulation. But since the HVAC system is the biggest energy consumer, modern building systems are designed to slow down the fan speed, which reduces the airflow. Maintaining adequate airflow is \"Airborne Infection Prevention 101.\" Without it, airborne infections can collect in high risk areas.  Building owners can save money on their utility bills, but they have put their occupants at risk.",

Over time, the complexity of these environments becomes unmanageable and costly due to never ending cycles of iterative upgrades, increasing compatibility challenges, and higher knowledge requirements.

Conventional security models have failed to prevent many high-profile incidents such as SolarWinds, OPM, Colonial Pipeline, WannaCry, NotPetya and Maersk. Administrators' access to sensitive data has become a growing insider threat risk. Traditional vetting has failed to predict or prevent leaks, such as Snowden, Manning, or the most recent Massachusetts Air National Guard incident.NUTS safeguards critical data and mitigates external and insider threats. NUTS treats data as a first-class citizen, and NUTS eases the burdens of cybersecurity on the operator by automating tasks like advanced encryption, key management and secure data sharing. NUTS security travels with the data so the security profile is cryptographically enforced in any computing node, from data center to the edge, whether network connected or not, thus allowing maximum flexibility for the operator and full assurance to administrators.",

    "problem_statement": "Historically, manufacturing was time, cost, and labor intensive. For technologically driven industries like aerospace, energy, and automotive this comes at the cost of innovation. A plurality of the OEMs, primes, and high-growth startups in the modern era are building the technology of the future on 50-100 year old supply chains. This culminates to 5-10+ year long manufacturing timelines when factoring design engineering, procurement, fulfillment, assembly, and testing that we have normalized.When the pandemic exposed domestic manufacturing capabilities and international supply chain predicaments, it was clear that western countries faced more issues. The unit economics of defense, space, and other heavy industries is at an all time low, and many vendors have gone out of business or changed focus. The ability to maintain vehicles, let alone develop additional vehicles is incredibly costly and timely, especially in harsher environments like on a battleship, in space, or by an oil rig.",

(NYSE: GXO), the world’s largest pure-play contract logistics provider, announced today that it has deployed advanced air and ground security robotics at one of its major distribution centers in Clayton, Ind., and plans to significantly increase deployment of automated security systems across other sites within the next year. This would be the largest air and ground security robotics fleet in the world. The DroneDog and DroneSentry duo, integrated with the DroneCore security platform from Asylon, Inc., are security technologies of the future, providing high-quality data and onsite activity updates that can detect potential issues in real time and simultaneously report them to the security team. Click here to see the DroneDog in action.\n“We launched the DroneDog and DroneSentry advanced security system at a customer’s facility that is more than 1 million square feet and requires a 24/7 security presence to safeguard our people and the products,” said Thomas Nelson, Senior Director of Security at GXO. “The combination of air and ground robotics gives us superb live video feed, including infrared vision for nighttime patrols, that we can operate, evaluate and respond to in real time.”\nGXO has already used these robotic assets to conduct more than 12,000 patrols or first-responder missions. The company also has used these robotic assets to investigate and clear alarms, as well as complete video-verified security audits, saving miles of walk time for team members. This technology is detecting potential issues in real time while making the environment safer for team members and securing the customer’s products."

Each of these technologies and companies only reveals one slice of the larger problem. With limited to no flow of data from one application to another, the current system ultimately forces the user to continuously jump between softwares, maintain and train inefficient manual flows, and keep up with multiple vendors and providers. Maintenance is also an inherently human function - people with hands-on-tools run the show. Softwares today don't understand their needs and this leads to digital transformation abandonment.",

It guarantees that only the authenticated user can operate the application/device by using continuous biometric authentication. The instant the user is not in front of their device or someone else (shoulder-surfer), the contents of their screen obfuscate.  The identity assurance is throughout the session, not just for access like current solutions. It is password-less and frictionless for the end-user, improving operational efficiency while increasing security.- Chaotic Hybrid Encryption (CHE).A Quantum Resistant Encryption that is low code and low latency.  It eliminates the Harvest Now/Decrypt Later (HNDL) of the upcoming \"quantum winter\".  CHE can be implemented in-line and it is 20-100 times faster that AES-256 (current military-grade encryption).  CHE leverages layers of proprietary technologies. It’s a one-time pad encryption, with an infinite-Key, generated from a chaotic oscillator, realized in a hybrid (mixed-signal) processor.  We don't share encryption keys, they are generated locally.We have SDKs ready to be licensed, so our clients (FinTech, HealthTech, Military, Government, etc.) can make their apps more secure with less friction to their users, reducing fraud (chargebacks), MITM attacks, Phishing, stolen credentials, etc.Additional information (including pitches, patents, infographics, white papers, repositories, and more) are available at https://LinkTr.ee/TheWhisperCompany.

Authentication and access to information needs to be biometric based and needs to be continuous.-----For those that are not aware, Quantum computing is not far from being a commercially viable technology.  Preparing for this day is more important than ever.  Adversaries, foreign and domestic are saving today’s data in troves. They call this \"act\" Harvest Now, Decrypt Later (HNDL). They already have our data, and are saving more and more day by day. The Financial industry amongst other proprietary information industries are all targets. They are holding this information and waiting for quantum computing capabilities to decrypt it.  Current encryption will be rendered obsolete.  We need quantum resistant encryption today.",

Furthermore, decentralized manufacturing facilities for emerging therapeutic modalities (i.e., autologous cell therapies and oligonucleotide-based therapies) are becoming increasing prevalent as new ways to provide quality, targeted, and economical health care for the public. These new and emerging technology approaches have more constrained product release deadlines, more complex contamination cases, and entail complex product matrices, making standard testing difficult, time consuming, or error prone.

    "problem_statement": "CONTACT:  Beth White, Founder and CEO -[email protected]Inefficiencies within companies waste time and money. Over 48% of CEOs cite AI and automating work is the answer to improving productivity and operational efficiencies, yet few know how to get started leveraging these technologies. And, many of the AI productivity solutions today (from Microsoft, Google, IBM, and OpenAI) are too expensive for most enterprise companies.With the rapid changes in workplaces, real-time employee support and communications are essential, and employee feedback is key to engagement/retention. Yet, HR, IT and Ops team members are overwhelmed and spend 2-3 hours a day manually responding to employees' FAQs and struggle to keep communications accurate and consistent. With both hybrid work and employee turnover challenges, companies lose 20%+ of their team members annually, that directly impacts the bottom line.MeBeBot provides employees with 24/7 support, real-time communications, and captures instant feedback, as an AI App in Microsoft Teams/Slack or webchat. With an AI Digital Employee Experience Platform, that leverages both generative AI and prescriptive AI, companies can launch a solution to their employees in weeks. As a first step in a path to accessible and affordable AI/automation, MeBeBot reduces manual support for employees by 60-70% and keeps them more productive and engaged, improving overall retention.",

Our products provide a cost-effective solution to improve control, facilitate meaningful automation and provide the optimization benefits promised by IIoT; reducing energy consumption and the associated carbon footprint by up-to 50%. Many industrial systems have synchronous electric motors for prime movers and use simple on/off control or employ energy wasting control techniques such as braking, choking or recirculation.  These control schemes waste energy and do not provide optimum performance from the system.  An alternative solution uses electrical control systems such as variable frequency, AC or DC drives.  These systems are often expensive to retrofit, take significant space due to low power density, require advanced power electronics to provide energy efficiency improvements and are not suitable for harsh environments without additional expensive protection systems.",

    "problem_statement": "Methane, a greenhouse gas 25x more potent than carbon dioxide, strongly contributes to global warming and degrades air quality. Methane leaks occur in both oil and gas production and distribution infrastructure. Colorado is a major oil and gas producer and the industry is an important source of jobs and economic growth in our state. Colorado is also considered the national leader in policy to control methane emissions. Methane emissions is a high profile issue in Colorado and a major priority for both industry and regulators alike.Over the past 6 years, Black Swift Technologies (BST) has developed unmanned aircraft systems (UAS) and sensor technologies that put the company in the position to meet a critical unmet need in the Oil and Gas production and regulatory industries; the capability to monitor 100 well sites for methane leaks in a single day, inexpensively, with  extraordinarily high sensitivity and precise geolocation. The cost per wellsite for a survey with this technology is less than $35, compared with a $500+ price for the current gold-standard approaches to methane leak detection.",

Founded in 2019, Exosonic has raised $4.5M+ in private capital and $3M+ in AFWERX funding.

Today's fighter pilots either train against very expensive operational aircraft like F-35s, F-22s, or F-16s. To save on cost, the USAF and US Navy hire air combat training companies who fly 60 - 70 year old aircraft platforms acting as 21st century enemy fighter aircraft. Needless to say, these give US fighter pilots a false sense of air superiority in training which may not translate well in actual combat. Exosonic wants to be at least 2x cheaper than existing commercial solutions (or 3 - 5x cheaper than existing government solutions) by developing supersonic UAVs that actually represent today's adversaries. These supersonic UAVs will allow fighter pilots to train like they fight so they can be adequately prepared to defend against enemy threats.",

We do this by converting empty apartments and managing them to attract a new type of renter looking for the convenience of furnished accommodation on flexible terms. Our furnished living on-demand product gives traveling professionals and digital nomads the service and consistency of a hotel with the spaciousness and function of a stylish home. It's also perfect for people who hate moving and assembling furniture! Our long-term vision is to build the operating system that powers apartment buildings anywhere globally to increase and diversify their NOI (net operating income) by incorporating hospitality into their revenue management mix..Why now? The pandemic has accelerated changes in how we live, work, and travel. We're switching from booking hotels to alternative accommodation. We're spending less time in the office or never going back. And that means we're no longer tied to a single location every day.Our competitors are rental arbitrage companies such as short-term rental brand Sonder and corporate housing operators. What differentiates us is that as the building's partner instead of tenant, we don't have a long-term commitment to pay a fixed monthly rent. Instead, we make money by charging a commission on the revenues generated, earning high-profit margins (75%). Our model better balances risk and rewards for owners: it generates more revenue in good times and eliminates the risk of a lease default in bad times. This last point is essential because three of the four largest competitors defaulted on their leases and went out of business during the pandemic.",

But people's lives don't always fit into neat 12-month sprints. Why does moving need to be so hard? Why do you need to own your furniture? And if you need temporary housing, you're stuck between flawed options: booking monotonous hotels or playing 'Airbnb roulette'. Hotels are expensive, and the rooms are small and not well suited to families or sharers. With no kitchen, you're forced to eat out or order expensive room service – a pain if you're staying more than a couple of nights.It's no surprise then that many apartment budlings are struggling with vacancy losses. They only market a single product: bare apartments on a long-term lease. In Houston, the average downtown building has forty empty units, costing them nearly a million dollars in vacancy loss each year! And worse, since buildings are valued on their cash flows, it's knocking millions of dollars off the potential value! Things are different overseas. Back in London (where I'm from), four out of every five properties are rented fully furnished on shorter terms. And that makes sense. The trend is for innovative companies to disrupt the status quo by providing more convenience and flexibility to consumers. Amazon changed how we shop. Netflix changed how we watch TV.

Our service works with family caregivers to help their loved ones age in place, maintain their independence, reduce senior isolation, and reduce caregiver stress.Family caregivers subscribe to our $55 monthly phone service for their loved-one and manage that service remotely through the Caregiver app. Most subscribe to our service to stop OUTGOING call problems, but they also love that we block 100% of the incoming telemarketer / scam calls as well. Caregivers set custom quiet hours to manage late-night calling and curb repeated dialing issues automatically. Caregivers can also limit incoming and outgoing calls to only pre-approved contacts. For seniors calling 911 unnecessarily, we can reroute these calls to nurses stations in a senior living community or to our EMT call center for seniors living independently.teleCalm’s patent-protected service is the ONLY service that stops outgoing call problems and restricts calls to only trusted contacts. teleCalm is a veteran and woman-owned social impact company.",

Most of these seniors have challenges using the phone; repeatedly calling friends & family, and calling all throughout the night. Many are easily swayed, buying everything they see on TV. They are also defrauded of $36 billion a year, 18% of which is by toxic family members and friends. Many also make unnecessary 911 calls resulting in fines to the families.There are an additional 24 million individuals with other cognitive challenges; including Autism, TBI, and the Intellectually Disabled -- many being cared for by the 50-plus age group as well. These challenges cause substantial loneliness, isolation, and stress, both to the individual and the family caregivers. Isolation has been proven to have negative mental as well as physical effects. This can increase the progression of the senior’s dementia, as well as the strain placed on the caregiver.This represents a TAM of $12.4 billion (34 million people) in the US alone.",

Our auto-deployment orchestration technology can synthesize the deployment code for any target platform using one universal set of perfected, platform-specific Libraries. These Libraries capture process details and prevent tribal knowledge loss. They also allow specific new workflows to be composed by less experienced engineers. Our software solution is platform and language agnostic and provides a framework to glue all other existing tools together. This means you can start making your scripts reusable from where your team is right now without having to learn a new language or start over. Our technology works on any layer of the stack from bare metal to infrastructure, to containers, to applications, and to application configuration.

Gartner notes, the agile development process is relatively organized but the Ops team process is still fairly disorganized. The USAF says that integrating and fielding software on the Ops side of DevOps is very complex and accounts for two-thirds of software spending. Add to that deployment scripts are having to be continually written and rewritten from scratch as they are often not valued or catalogued. Since target server information must be manually entered into each script they are at best only partially reusable. Engineers usually run a hand edited script for every API and a typical cloud deployment might cross 10 API. The result of all of this is long, billable hours sitting at a PC.
